App built in an afternoon to show abilities such as Data Persistance (Room database), Live Data (easier to migrate to a paginated list), MVVM, Retrofit, OKHttp, Glide, and RecyclerViews.
I didnt focus much on the design since its just a recyclerview with a small list. Per the requirements I coded this in Java.
